## Covariates
Your covariates file should be a text file (white space separated) with `IID` in the first column followed by headed columns for covariates. The following covariates are **required**:

- `Sex`: A column of `M`s for males and `F`s for females
- `Age`: In years

The following covariates are strongly recommended (but not necessary):

- `Slide`: The slide ID for the methylation array
- Any other important batches

The pipeline will create genetic and methylation principal components for you so you donâ€™t need to add PCs to this file. An example of what your file should look like is below:

    IID Sex Age Slide
    id1 F 30 12345678
    id2 M 42 12345678
    id3 M 76 87654321

Please ensure there are no missing values in the `Sex` and `Age` columns, even if your data is all the same age or all the same sex. Please also ensure that the capitalisation of column headers in the example above is followed.

## Phenotypes

We are expecting that you will provide `Height` and `BMI` phenotypes. Please provide them in the same format as the covariates, e.g.:

    IID Height BMI
    id1 1.62 23.1
    id2 1.89 20.6
    id4 1.70 22.7

Note the capitalisation!!

We are expecting height in metres and BMI in kg/m2 units.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** Any missing values for covariates or phenotypes will lead to the individual being excluded. Please ensure that this is kept to a minimum!

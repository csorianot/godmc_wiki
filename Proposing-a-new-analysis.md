## Motivation

The pipeline has been built with extendability, and we hope it can be a useful resource for the mDNA community. Because the first few steps coordinate, harmonise, clean and check genetic and methylation data, any future analysis can build on this invested effort by simply adding scripts to the pipeline that use the already processed data. This means that 

- New projects are fast to script up
- Consortium analysts don't need to spend a long time re-running data cleaning steps in order to run the new analyses

Therefore, in principal it should be very fast to run new analyses.


## Process

We are very keen for this process to be as decentralised as possible. The steps for a new proposal to be implemented are as follows:

1. The lead analyst for the new proposal writes a brief research proposal (e.g. one A4 page) which has the following headings:

    - Scientific background
    - Data required
    - Computation required
    - Ethical considerations
    
    The lead analyst uploads the proposal to ...
2. Await approval from the GoDMC core PIs. Proposals are checked for
    - Over
3. The lead analyst is then responsible for
    - contacting other members of the consortium
    - extending the pipeline
    - coordinating the analysis amongst the other cohorts
    - and all subsequent meta analysis and write up

## Support

The GoDMC lead developers will be available to provide support where necessary, but this won't be a priority of theirs.

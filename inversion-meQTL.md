We will run a meQTL analysis using the chromosomal inversions. We will use the same strategy than in GoDMC phase 2 but including all CpGs and inversions. We will use the normalized and adjusted methylation data and the inversion genotypes inferred in the previous step.

You can run this step with:
    
    ./21-inversionmeQTL.sh

For a sample size of 400, this step took 12 hours to complete.
